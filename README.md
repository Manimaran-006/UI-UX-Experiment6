## UI–UX – Experiment 6

## Aim:

To practice solution ideation, user story creation, scenario development, flow mapping, and information architecture design to improve user experience through structured UX design activities.



## Problem Statement:

Scenario: Designing a Food Delivery App that allows users to browse restaurants, customize food orders, track deliveries, and make quick payments with minimal steps.

Solution Ideation Task: Conduct *Crazy 8s* ideation to generate multiple low-fidelity ideas to simplify the ordering and delivery experience.



## 1. Solution Ideation Exercise Used:

Method: Crazy 8s (8 ideas in 8 minutes)

Low-Fidelity Idea Concepts:

1. Smart Reorder – One-tap reorder from past favorites.
2. Voice Ordering – Speak your food order to add items to cart.
3. Mood-Based Suggestions – Suggests dishes based on user mood or weather.
4. Group Ordering – Split order and bill among friends automatically.
5. Quick Filter Buttons – “Fast Delivery”, “Healthy”, “Budget Meals” filters on the home screen.
6. Live Delivery Tracker – Real-time driver location with estimated arrival countdown.
7. No-Contact Delivery – Option for doorstep drop-off with photo confirmation.
8. AI Food Recommendation – Suggests new dishes based on previous ratings.



 2. Creating User Stories

User Personas:

* Arjun, 26, Software Developer — orders food during work hours, values speed.
* Priya, 35, Working Mom — orders for family, prefers accurate delivery and safety.
* Rahul, 21, Student — loves offers and trying new restaurants.

User Stories:

1. As a busy professional, I want to reorder my last meal in one tap, so that I can save time.
2. As a parent, I want to track my delivery in real time, so that I know when to expect food for my family.
3. As a student, I want to see current discounts easily, so that I can save money on meals.
4. As a group of friends, we want to split the bill directly in the app, so that payment is hassle-free.
5. As a health-conscious user, I want to filter restaurants by calorie count, so that I can maintain my diet goals.



## 3. Creating Scenarios

Selected User Story:
*As a busy professional, I want to reorder my last meal in one tap, so that I can save time.*

Scenario:
Arjun has just finished a long meeting and has no time to cook. During his break, he opens the food delivery app. On the home screen, he sees a “Reorder Your Favorites” section with his last ordered meal from his preferred restaurant. With one tap, he confirms the order, selects digital payment, and proceeds. Within seconds, he gets a confirmation message and live tracking of the delivery. Feeling relaxed, Arjun continues his work knowing food will arrive on time.



## 4. Flow Diagrams / Flow Mapping

Task: Order food through the app.

Flow Diagram Symbols Used:

* Start / End → Oval
* Process / Action → Rectangle
* Decision → Diamond

Categories Given to Users:

     * Home
     * Restaurants
     * Cart
     * Orders
     * Offers & Rewards

     * Help

Sample Sorted Cards:

     * Find restaurants → Restaurants
     * Apply promo code → Offers & Rewards
     * Payment history → Orders
     * Edit address → Profile & Settings
     * FAQs → Help
     * View current order → Orders

## Result:

The experiment was successfully completed.
Through this activity, we practiced structured UX design tasks — ideation, user story writing, scenario creation, flow mapping, and information architecture. The exercise improved understanding of how to organize app functions logically and design intuitive, user-centered experiences for a food delivery platform.



Would you like me to make a hospital-based version (like your previous experiment) or another e-commerce website version for variety in your lab record?
